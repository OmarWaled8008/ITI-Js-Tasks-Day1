# JavaScript Tasks - Day 1 (ITI 9-Month Diploma)

This repository contains the JavaScript practice tasks completed on **Day 1** of the ITI 9-month diploma program. Each task demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts such as prompts, conditions, loops, arithmetic operations, and DOM manipulation.

## üìÅ Tasks Overview

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Dynamic Headers
- **Description:** Prompts the user for a number between 1 and 6 and displays that many HTML headers (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
- **Key Concepts:** `prompt`, `document.write`, conditional rendering.

- **Key Concepts:** `do...while` loop, `prompt`, `alert`, input validation.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Compare Two Numbers
- **Description:** Prompts the user for two numbers and displays the larger one.
- **Key Concepts:** Input validation, conditional (`if/else`), number parsing.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Divisibility Check
- **Description:** Prompts for three numbers. Checks if the first number is divisible by the second and third.
- **Key Concepts:** Modulo operator (`%`), multiple condition checks, function usage.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 5: Multiples of 3 and 5
- **Description:** Finds all numbers divisible by 3 or 5 in a given range (1‚Äì10), and logs them separately in the console.
- **Key Concepts:** Looping, conditional checks, array usage, `console.log`.
